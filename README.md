Hello all.

My name is Kevin Phillips, and I am a profressional software developer. This is my GitHub profile that I use for organizing and storing reference material for my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDryNbDQKT0vFweQcrPX92g). The repositories here contain sample code that I use for demonstration purposes on my channel, and can be used as reference material by my followers to learn and compare notes.
